# Fleet Simulator

A testing tool for the Shingo warehouse dispatch system. The simulator replaces the real SEER RDS fleet server with a fake version that runs entirely in software, so you can test the full order lifecycle (dispatch, robot movement, bin arrival, claim release) without robots, RDS, Kafka, or Edge hardware.

This document is written for anyone who needs to understand what the simulator tests, what it found, and how to use it. You don't need to be a software developer to follow along.

---

## How it works

When Shingo Core sends an order to the fleet, it normally goes to the SEER RDS server which controls the physical robots. The simulator intercepts that communication and pretends to be RDS. It accepts orders, records what blocks and bin tasks were sent, and lets you manually advance the robot through its stages (created, running, waiting, finished).

The test database is a real Postgres database running inside Docker on your machine. Everything the dispatcher writes (orders, bin claims, status changes) goes into this real database, so the tests verify actual database behavior, not mocked-up responses.

```
Your test code  ──▶  Dispatcher (real production code)  ──▶  Simulator (fake fleet)
       │                        │                                    │
       │                        ▼                                    │
       │                 Real Postgres DB                            │
       │                  (via Docker)                               │
       ▼                                                             ▼
  Checks database                                            Records what the
  for correct state                                          "fleet" received
```

The dispatcher doesn't know it's not talking to real robots. The simulator just records what it gets. Your test code sets up the scenario, triggers the actions, and checks the results.

---

## Running the tests

Docker Desktop must be running. The tests spin up a temporary Postgres container automatically. First run pulls the image (one time), after that it's cached. The container is torn down when the test finishes.

Run all simulator tests:

```
cd shingo-core
go test -v -run "TestSimulator|TestClaimBin" ./engine/ ./dispatch/ -timeout 120s
```

Run a specific test:

```
go test -v -run TestSimulator_FullLifecycle ./engine/ -timeout 60s
```

If Docker isn't running, database tests skip automatically (they won't fail your build). Pure logic tests like state mapping always run.

## How to read this document

Each test case in this document follows the same format so you can quickly find what you need:

- **Scenario** describes the situation in plain language — what's happening on the floor and what could go wrong. You don't need to read code to understand the risk.
- **Expected behavior** explains what the system is supposed to do. This is the "right answer" — if the system doesn't do this, something is broken.
- **Result** tells you whether the test passed, and if a bug was found, what happened and how it was fixed.
- **Code snippets** (where included) show the key lines from the test. These are optional reading — they're there for anyone who wants to trace the exact check, but the scenario and result tell the full story without them.
- **Test** at the bottom of each entry gives the file name and test function, so a developer can find and run the specific test.

Test cases marked "PASS" are green — the system handles that scenario correctly. Cases marked "BUG FOUND AND FIXED" had a real problem that has been corrected and is now covered by a regression test so it can't come back silently.

The "Scenarios to test next" section at the end is a prioritized catalog of situations we haven't tested yet. These are written the same way (scenario + expected behavior) so they can be turned into tests as the project continues.

## Tested scenarios

Each entry below describes a scenario that could happen on the factory floor, what the system should do, and what we found when we tested it. Scenarios are tested before they become problems in production.

---

### TC-1: Robot drives to a location but doesn't pick up the bin — PASS

**Scenario:** You send a complex order — pick up a bin from storage, drop it off at the line. The robot drives to the storage location. But what if the instructions don't tell the robot to actually jack the bin? The robot arrives, sits there, and drives away empty. The bin never moves.

**Expected behavior:** Every instruction block sent to the fleet must include a bin task — either JackLoad (pick up the bin) or JackUnload (set it down). The pickup block should be at the storage node, the dropoff block at the line node.

**Result:** PASS. Every block includes the correct bin task and location. This was a real bug found on the floor (2026-03-26) and has since been fixed. This test ensures it never comes back.

```go
// Every block the fleet receives must tell the robot what to do with the bin
for _, b := range blocks {
    if b.BinTask == "" {
        t.Errorf("block %q at %q has empty BinTask — robots would navigate without jacking",
            b.BlockID, b.Location)
    }
}
```

**Test:** `dispatch/fleet_simulator_test.go` — `TestSimulator_ComplexOrderBinTasks`

---

### TC-2: Robot is waiting at staging but the release doesn't go through — PASS (after fix)

**Scenario:** A cycle order: robot picks up from storage, drops off at the line staging area, and waits for the operator. When the operator is done, they release the order and the robot continues — picks up from staging and returns to storage. But what if the release command gets rejected because the system doesn't realize the robot is actually waiting?

**Expected behavior:** When the robot reaches the waiting point, the system should update the order status to "staged." The release command should only be accepted when the order is in "staged" status. After release, the remaining instructions (pick up from staging, return to storage) should be appended to the robot's task.

**Result:** PASS after rewriting the test. The original test had a bug — it was sending the release while the order was still "dispatched" instead of "staged," so the release was silently rejected and the test passed without actually testing anything. The test now drives the robot through the full sequence: CREATED → RUNNING → WAITING (status becomes "staged") → release → RUNNING → FINISHED.

```go
// Robot reaches wait point — system sets status to "staged"
sim.DriveState(order.VendorOrderID, "WAITING")
// Release only works when status is "staged"
d.HandleOrderRelease(env, &protocol.OrderRelease{OrderUUID: "staged-tc2"})
// 2 pre-wait + 2 post-wait = 4 blocks total
assert(len(view.Blocks) == 4 && view.Complete == true)
```

**Test:** `engine/engine_test.go` — `TestSimulator_StagedComplexOrderRelease`

---

### TC-3: Basic retrieve order sends the right instructions to the fleet — PASS

**Scenario:** The simplest possible operation — request a bin from storage and deliver it to the production line. What if the system sends the wrong locations, or doesn't tell the robot to pick up and set down?

**Expected behavior:** The fleet should receive exactly 2 instruction blocks: JackLoad (pick up) at the storage node, JackUnload (set down) at the line node.

**Result:** PASS. The dispatch pipeline creates the correct transport order with the right block structure and locations.

**Test:** `dispatch/fleet_simulator_test.go` — `TestSimulator_SimpleRetrieveOrder`

---

### TC-4: System misinterprets what the robot is doing — PASS (after fix)

**Scenario:** The fleet reports that a robot is in state "WAITING." The system needs to translate that into a Shingo status. What if the translation is wrong? If WAITING maps to the wrong status, the system won't know the robot is at the staging point, and operator releases will be rejected.

**Expected behavior:** Every fleet state must map to the correct Shingo status, matching exactly what the real RDS adapter does: CREATED → dispatched, RUNNING → in_transit, WAITING → staged, FINISHED → delivered, FAILED → failed, STOPPED → cancelled.

**Result:** PASS after fixing two mapping errors. The simulator was mapping WAITING to "waiting" instead of "staged," and was missing the TOBEDISPATCHED state entirely. Both were corrected. This directly affected TC-2 — with the wrong mapping, staged order releases would always be rejected.

**Test:** `dispatch/fleet_simulator_test.go` — `TestSimulator_StateMapping`

---

### TC-5: Fleet is down — system creates phantom return orders — PASS

**Scenario:** The fleet server is unreachable and rejects order creation. The system marks the order as failed. But what if the failure handler then tries to create a "return" order to send the bin back? The bin never left — the fleet never accepted the order — so a return order makes no sense and creates confusion about where bins actually are.

**Expected behavior:** When the fleet rejects order creation, the order should be marked as failed with no vendor order ID. No return order should be created.

**Result:** PASS. The order is correctly marked as failed, has no vendor order ID, and no phantom orders exist in the simulator.

**Test:** `dispatch/fleet_simulator_test.go` — `TestSimulator_FleetFailure_NoVendorOrderID`

---

### TC-15: Full order lifecycle from dispatch to bin arrival — PASS

**Scenario:** A retrieve order goes through its entire lifecycle: dispatch, robot picks up, robot drives to the line, robot arrives, the Edge station confirms the bin arrived, and the system updates inventory. What if any step in this chain breaks? The bin might not move in the database, the claim might not release, or the order might get stuck in "delivered" forever.

**Expected behavior:** The complete chain should work end-to-end: dispatched → in_transit → delivered → Edge confirms receipt → bin moves to destination node → claim released → order confirmed.

**Result:** PASS. The entire feedback loop works. This is the most important test because it exercises every layer of the system.

One important detail this test verifies: the robot arriving (FINISHED) does not automatically move the bin. The Edge station must confirm receipt first. This matches real production behavior — the operator confirms the bin is actually there before the system updates inventory.

```go
// 1. Dispatch order
d.HandleOrderRequest(env, &protocol.OrderRequest{...})
assert(order.Status == "dispatched")

// 2-3. Robot moves and arrives — bin has NOT moved yet
sim.DriveState(order.VendorOrderID, "RUNNING")   // → "in_transit"
sim.DriveState(order.VendorOrderID, "FINISHED")   // → "delivered"

// 4. Edge confirms receipt — NOW the bin moves
d.HandleOrderReceipt(env, &protocol.OrderReceipt{...})
assert(order.Status == "confirmed")

// 5. Verify: bin at destination, claim released
assert(*bin.NodeID == lineNode.ID)    // bin moved
assert(bin.ClaimedBy == nil)           // claim released
```

**Test:** `engine/engine_test.go` — `TestSimulator_FullLifecycle`

---

### ClaimBin: Two orders claim the same bin — BUG FOUND AND FIXED

**Scenario:** Two production lines both need the same part at roughly the same time. Both orders query for available bins and find the same one. The first order claims it. Then the second order claims the same bin. What happens to the first order's reservation?

**Expected behavior:** The second claim should be rejected. The bin is already reserved by the first order. The second order should get an error and look for a different bin.

**Result:** BUG FOUND. The second claim silently succeeded. The bin's reservation was overwritten from order 100 to order 200 with no error. The first order still thought it had a bin reserved, but that bin was now committed to the second order. When the first order's robot arrived, the bin could already be gone.

**Root cause:** The database query that claims a bin checked if the bin was locked, but never checked if it was already claimed by another order.

```sql
-- Before (broken): silently overwrites existing claims
UPDATE bins SET claimed_by=$1 WHERE id=$2 AND locked=false

-- After (fixed): rejects claim if bin is already reserved
UPDATE bins SET claimed_by=$1 WHERE id=$2 AND locked=false AND claimed_by IS NULL
```

**Production risk:** Under normal load, this race window is narrow because the system filters out already-claimed bins before attempting to claim. But with multiple lines requesting parts simultaneously, two orders can both find the same bin in the gap between one order's search and its claim. This is more likely during shift starts or when inventory is low.

**Status:** Fixed. The second claim now returns an error: `"bin 1 is locked, already claimed, or does not exist"`.

**Test:** `engine/engine_test.go` — `TestClaimBin_SilentOverwrite`

---

## Scenarios to test next

These scenarios haven't been tested yet. Each one describes something that could go wrong on the floor and what the system should do about it.

### Bin reservation problems (highest priority)

A reservation ("claim") bug means the system's record of which bins are committed to which orders doesn't match reality. These are the most dangerous because they can cause robots to arrive at empty locations or bins to become permanently stuck.

**TC-25: Robot breaks down mid-delivery — does the bin reservation release?** A robot is carrying a bin and breaks down. The fleet marks the order as failed. The bin claim should be automatically released so the system knows that bin is available for a new attempt. If it doesn't release, the system thinks a robot is still coming for it and no one else can use it.

**TC-26: Operator cancels an order — does the bin reservation release?** Same as above, but the operator cancels instead of the robot failing. The bin was reserved but the order is no longer happening. The reservation must release.

**TC-27: Operator redirects a robot — does the bin reservation survive?** A robot is mid-delivery and the operator redirects it to a different destination. The bin is still on the robot — the reservation should stay intact. Only the destination changes.

**TC-28: Two lines request the same part at the same time.** Line 1 and Line 2 both need PART-A. There are two bins of PART-A in storage. Each order should get a different bin. What if the system gives both orders the same bin? One robot arrives to find an empty shelf.

**TC-29: Operator cancels while the robot is in transit.** The robot is already moving with the bin. The operator cancels. The reservation should release cleanly even though the robot hasn't arrived yet.

**TC-30: Failed order creates a return — does the return inherit the reservation?** An order fails and the system automatically creates a return order to send the bin back. The return order should not inherit the original claim. The original claim should already be gone because the failure handler released it.

**TC-32: Bin sits at staging too long — what happens to the reservation?** A bin has been at a staging area past its expiry time. The system releases the staging status. But if that bin was reserved by an active order, does the reservation also get cleaned up? Or is it left dangling?

**TC-33: Operator manually moves a reserved bin.** An operator requests a manual move on a bin that is reserved by an active order. Should the system block the move? Release the reservation? Allow both and hope for the best?

### Timing and race conditions

**TC-6: Operator cancels at the exact moment the fleet accepts the order.** The cancel and the fleet acceptance happen at nearly the same time. Does the system end up in a clean state, or does the order get stuck — the fleet thinks it's active, the system thinks it's cancelled?

**TC-7: Operator releases before the robot has arrived at the wait point.** The Edge sends a release command for a staged order, but the robot hasn't actually reached the waiting state yet. The release should be rejected — the robot isn't there to continue.

**TC-8: Operator accidentally sends the release command twice.** Edge sends the release twice in a row. The second release should be ignored. It should not append duplicate blocks to the robot's instructions.

### Bad input handling

**TC-9: Complex order with zero steps.** Someone sends an order request with no steps. The system should fail with a clear error, not crash or create a broken order.

**TC-10: Order references a node that doesn't exist.** The order specifies a pickup or delivery node name that isn't in the database. Should fail with "node not found" instead of creating a partial order.

**TC-11: Only available bin is at a disabled storage node.** The storage node is marked as disabled (out of service). The system should not dispatch from disabled nodes — it should report no inventory available rather than sending a robot to a node that's offline.

**TC-12: Order requests zero quantity.** Someone sends an order for 0 bins. Should be rejected as invalid.

### Multi-line and inventory scenarios

**TC-20: Two lines run the same assembly — does one line steal from the other's staging?** Line 1 and Line 2 both assemble the same product. Line 1 has a bin staged and waiting. Line 2 requests the same part. Will the system try to pull from Line 1's staging area? It shouldn't — those bins are committed to active orders on Line 1.

**TC-21: The only available bin is in quality hold.** A line requests a part. There's one bin of that part in the warehouse, but it's in quality hold (flagged for inspection). The system should not dispatch a held bin. It should report no inventory available and let the fulfillment scanner retry when inventory frees up.

**TC-22: The only available bin is in the maintenance area.** Similar to quality hold, but the bin is physically at a maintenance node. The system should skip it.

**TC-23: Operator manually moves a staged bin.** A bin is sitting at a staging area, waiting for a robot to pick it up as part of an active order. An operator manually moves that bin somewhere else. What happens to the order that was expecting it?

**TC-24: One order finishes and frees a bin — does the next order pick it up?** Order A completes and releases its bin. Order B has been waiting because there was no inventory. Does the fulfillment scanner detect the newly available bin and dispatch Order B automatically?

### Fleet behavior edge cases

**TC-16: Fleet reports an unknown state.** The fleet sends a state string that the system doesn't recognize. Should map to a safe default status, not crash the event pipeline.

**TC-17: Fleet reports the same state twice.** The fleet says the robot is RUNNING, then says RUNNING again. The system should treat this as a no-op — no duplicate events, no double database updates.

**TC-18: Fleet reports states out of order.** The fleet says FINISHED before it ever said RUNNING. This can happen if a status poll is missed. The system should handle it gracefully and end up in the correct final state.

**TC-19: Robot completes a very short trip.** The fleet goes through CREATED → RUNNING → FINISHED in rapid succession (robot was right next to the destination). All three state changes should be processed correctly despite the speed.

## Architecture reference

This section describes how the simulation harness is built, for anyone who needs to add new tests or modify the simulator.

### The simulation harness

The engine test harness (`newTestEngine`) creates a real Shingo Engine connected to the simulator instead of RDS. When you call `sim.DriveState()` to advance a simulated robot, the following chain fires automatically:

```
sim.DriveState("RUNNING")
    → Simulator emits OrderStatusChanged event
    → Engine's EventBus delivers event to handleVendorStatusChange
    → Handler updates order status in database
    → Handler notifies Edge (writes to outbox table, goes nowhere in tests)

sim.DriveState("FINISHED")
    → Same chain → status becomes "delivered"

dispatcher.HandleOrderReceipt(...)     (simulates Edge confirmation)
    → ConfirmReceipt → EventOrderCompleted
    → handleOrderCompleted → ApplyBinArrival
    → Bin moves to destination node in database
    → Bin claim released
```

The key detail: the robot finishing (FINISHED) does not move the bin. The Edge station must confirm receipt first. This matches real production behavior and prevents inventory from updating before a human confirms the bin actually arrived.

### Important technical constraints

**Receipt required for bin movement.** Tests that verify bin movement must call `HandleOrderReceipt` after driving to FINISHED. Without this step, the bin stays at its original location in the database.

**State changes fire events automatically.** When the simulator is wired into an Engine via `newTestEngine`, calling `DriveState` automatically fires events through the engine pipeline. Tests don't need to manually emit events.

**Each test gets a fresh database.** Every test function spins up its own Postgres container, so tests cannot interfere with each other. Container startup takes about 1-2 seconds.

## Future: Edge simulation

The current simulator replaces the fleet (RDS). A future addition would simulate the Edge station as well, allowing tests to verify the full round-trip: Core dispatches → robot moves → Edge detects arrival → Edge sends receipt → Core completes order.

Today, tests simulate Edge by manually calling `HandleOrderReceipt` on the dispatcher. A dedicated Edge simulator would make this more realistic by modeling the Edge's state machine (order tracking, receipt generation, staged order release timing).

This is not yet built. The current approach (manual receipt calls) is sufficient for testing Core's behavior. Edge simulation would be valuable when testing timing-dependent scenarios like "what happens if the Edge receipt arrives before the fleet reports FINISHED."
